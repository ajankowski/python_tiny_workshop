we are working using jupyter notebook

there are 3 ways to do it:
- local (requires installation)
- own cloud (requires expensive hw)
- google colab (requires google account)

today you have 2 options:
- 167.172.36.73
- google colab

support:
- we have separate google meet channel for support
- rise your hand
- put question in chat box
- put '...' in chat box and you get an option to ask question

communication:
- chat window is your main channel
- i will ask questions and expect you to put answers in chat

please, please speak up
- don't worry you don't know, i still to do a training without making mistakes
- i cannot see you
- it is close to impossible to know how im doing, 

evaluation:
- super important
- we will have more sessions, you do evaluation for yourself
- if enough of you vote for it i will add additionl programming session :-)

what is the purpose of the session:
- we will open a bonnet of a car called AI
- to understand what's there, you need to recognize what you see
- it won't teach you enough programming to be dangerous, but hopefully can hook you up
